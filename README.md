# PSYC-259-Final-Project

This Repository contains the MATLAB codes to perform data cleaning and analyses on a subset of a Visual Integration project to compare the performance of patients 
with Schizophrenia and Neurotypical Individuals

Steps to Execute:
1. If you have MATLAB software, then execute the code titled "Training_Data_Analysis_NT.m" within the "PSYC-259-Final-Project/Codes/NT" folder first
2. Then, proceed to execute the code titled "Training_Data_Analysis_SP.m" within the "PSYC-259-Final-Project/Codes/SP" folder. This will generate the necessary .csv files
3. Copy the .csv files into the main "PSYC-259-Final-Project" folder
4. Then open RStudio and execute the "Final_Project_Report.rmd" markdown file within R
5. This will generate a html document of the final report with graphs for visualizing the data.

Note: All these steps are already performed and the final files are present in the repository. Raw data logs are also included within the "Codes/SP or Codes/NT" folders 
for reference.
